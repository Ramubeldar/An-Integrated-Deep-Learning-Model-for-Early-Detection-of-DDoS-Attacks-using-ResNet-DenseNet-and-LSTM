Abstractâ€”Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks
represent a considerable danger to the accessibility and
functionality of online services. Various machine-learning
approaches have been proposed to detect and classify DDoS
traffic. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines
ResNet, DenseNet, and LSTM neural networks to mitigate
the impact of such attacks with accurate and efficient DDoS
detection. The proposed approach leverages the strengths of these
architectures by utilizing the residual connections in ResNet,
dense connections in DenseNet, and memory cells in LSTM. Our
method first extracts high-level features from network traffic
using a ResNet-based convolutional neural network. These
features are then fed into a DenseNet-based feature extraction
module to capture local and global correlations in the data.
Lastly, a sequence classifier based on LSTM is utilized to model
the temporal dependencies in the feature sequences, enabling the
model to make an accurate decision. We evaluate our approach
to publicly available datasets of DDoS attacks, specifically
the (CIC-DDoS2019) dataset, and compare it with several
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior detection accuracy and
efficiency with a significantly reduced false positive rate. This
work can improve the effectiveness of DDoS defense mechanisms
and enhance the resilience of online services against DDoS
attacks. In conclusion, our proposed approach presents a new
and effective means of detecting and mitigating DDoS attacks
and has the potential to improve the security of online services
significantly.
